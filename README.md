# ConfigRiskMetric
A little thing I thought up...


This is a little project that I thought up to deal with the issue of communicating the potential risk of the overall network as the network configuration starts to drift from the intitial "golden" state to the dirty mess that often happens because the network is brought in to resolve issues that should have been solved at another layer of the stack. 

This is a proof of concept only to gather feedback from the community as to whether or not they see value in this approach. 

It might become something, it might not. 

Either way, I think it's good to have the converstaion, don't you?
